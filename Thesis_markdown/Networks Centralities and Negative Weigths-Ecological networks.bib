abstract = {Studies of complex networks show that nodes with high centrality scores are important to network structure and stability. Following this rationale, centrality measures can be used to (i) identify keystone species in ecological networks, a major issue in community ecology, and (ii) differentiate the keystone species concept, e.g. species may play a key role in a network for different topological reasons. In 34 pollination communities we examine the relationship between the generalization level of species (ND) and two complementary centrality indices: closeness (CC) and betweenness centrality (BC). CC measures the proximity of a species to all other species in the community, while BC describes the importance of a species as a connector. Most networks had a linear ND-CC relationship with a minimum CC value of 0.41. Hence, species were close to each and will be likely to be rapidly affected by disturbances. Contrarily, in most networks, the ND-BC relationships were power-law distributed with exponents larger than one. Only 59{\%} of the species were connectors (BC {\textgreater} 0). In particular, there was a connector threshold value of ND = 0.46. Species above this threshold represent ???40{\%}, almost all of which were connectors. These results indicate that in pollination systems the most generalized species are usually network keystone species, playing at least two roles: (i) interact closely with most other species (high CC) and (ii) connect otherwise unconnected subnetworks (high BC). We discuss the implications of centrality measures to community-based conservation ecology. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Jordan2009a,
abstract = {Different species are of different importance in maintaining ecosystem functions in natural communities. Quantitative approaches are needed to identify unusually important or influential, 'keystone' species particularly for conservation purposes. Since the importance of some species may largely be the consequence of their rich interaction structure, one possible quantitative approach to identify the most influential species is to study their position in the network of interspecific interactions. In this paper, I discuss the role of network analysis (and centrality indices in particular) in this process and present a new and simple approach to characterizing the interaction structures of each species in a complex network. Understanding the linkage between structure and dynamics is a condition to test the results of topological studies, I briefly overview our current knowledge on this issue. The study of key nodes in networks has become an increasingly general interest in several disciplines: I will discuss some parallels. Finally, I will argue that conservation biology needs to devote more attention to identify and conserve keystone species and relatively less attention to rarity.},

@article{Estrada2007a,
abstract = {An important question in the network representation of ecological systems is to determine how direct and indirect interactions between species determine the positional importance of species in the ecosystem. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the similarities and differences of six different topological centrality measures as indicators of keystone species in 17 food webs. These indicators account for local, global and "meso-scale" - intermediate between local and global - topological information about species in the food webs. Using factor analysis we shown that most of these centrality indices share a great deal of topological information, which range from 75{\%} to 96{\%}. A generalized keystone indicator is then proposed by considering the factor loadings of the six-centrality measures, which contains most of the information encoded by these indices. However, the individual ordering of species according to these criteria display significant differences in most food webs. We simulate the effects of species extinction by removing species ranked according to a local and a "meso-scale" centrality indicator. The differences observed on three network characteristics - size, average distance and clustering coefficient of the largest component - after the removal of the most central nodes indicate that the consideration of these indices have different impacts for the ranking of species with conservational biology purposes. The "meso-scale" indicator appears to play an important role in determining the relative importance of species in epidemic spread and parasitism rates. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Demographic loop analysis is one of the basic methods applied in life cycle analysis in population ecology. Here, we developed an R package called "loop" to implement the algorithmic approach of loop analysis developed by a previous work. Additionally, the package can provide flexible network plotting and food web analysis as well. In this paper we illustrated the loop decomposition analysis using the life-cycle graph of a tropical tree species Vouacapoua americana; and performed food web statistics for the two real food webs for illustrating food web plotting and detecting key species in securing food web persistence.
