abstract = {Traditionally, protein structures have been analysed by the secondary structure architecture and fold arrangement. An alternative approach that has shown promise is modelling proteins as a network of non-covalent interactions between amino acid residues. The network representation of proteins provide a systems approach to topological analysis of complex three-dimensional structures irrespective of secondary structure and fold type and provide insights into structure-function relationship. We have developed a web server for network based analysis of protein structures, NAPS, that facilitates quantitative and qualitative (visual) analysis of residue-residue interactions in: single chains, protein complex, modelled protein structures and trajectories (e.g. from molecular dynamics simulations). The user can specify atom type for network construction, distance range (in {\AA}) and minimal amino acid separation along the sequence. NAPS provides users selection of node(s) and its neighbourhood based on centrality measures, physicochemical properties of amino acids or cluster of well-connected residues (k-cliques) for further analysis. Visual analysis of interacting domains and protein chains, and shortest path lengths between pair of residues are additional features that aid in functional analysis. NAPS support various analyses and visualization views for identifying functional residues, provide insight into mechanisms of protein folding, domain-domain and protein-protein interactions for understanding communication within and between proteins.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic approaches are commonly used to predict which amino acid residues are critical to the function of a given protein. However, such approaches display inherent limitations, such as the requirement for identification of multiple homologues of the protein under consideration. Therefore, complementary or alternative approaches for the prediction of critical residues would be desirable. Network analyses have been used in the modelling of many complex biological systems, but only very recently have they been used to predict critical residues from a protein's three-dimensional structure. Here we compare a couple of phylogenetic approaches to several different network-based methods for the prediction of critical residues, and show that a combination of one phylogenetic method and one network-based method is superior to other methods previously employed. RESULTS: We associate a network with each member of a set of proteins for which the three-dimensional structure is known and the critical residues have been previously determined experimentally. We show that several network-based centrality measurements (connectivity, 2-connectivity, closeness centrality, betweenness and cluster coefficient) accurately detect residues critical for the protein's function. Phylogenetic approaches render predictions as reliable as the network-based measurements, although, interestingly, the two general approaches tend to predict different sets of critical residues. Hence we propose a hybrid method that is composed of one network-based calculation--the closeness centrality--and one phylogenetic approach--the Conseq server. This hybrid approach predicts critical residues more accurately than the other methods tested here. CONCLUSION: We show that network analysis can be used to improve the prediction of amino acids critical for protein function, when utilized in combination with phylogenetic approaches. It is proposed that such improvement is due to the complementary nature of these approaches: network-based methods tend to predict as critical those residues that are highly connected and internal (i.e., non-surface), although some surface residues are indeed identified as critical by network analyses; whereas residues chosen by phylogenetic approaches display a lower overall probability of being surface inaccessible.},

@article{Papaleo2015a,
abstract = {In the last years, we have been observing remarkable improvements in the field of protein dynamics. Indeed, we can now study protein dynamics in atomistic details over several timescales with a rich portfolio of experimental and computational techniques. On one side, this provides us with the possibility to validate simulation methods and physical models against a broad range of experimental observables. On the other side, it also allows a complementary and comprehensive view on protein structure and dynamics. What is needed now is a better understanding of the link between the dynamic properties that we observe and the functional properties of these important cellular machines. To make progresses in this direction, we need to improve the physical models used to describe proteins and solvent in molecular dynamics, as well as to strengthen the integration of experiments and simulations to overcome their own limitations. Moreover, now that we have the means to study protein dynamics in great details, we need new tools to understand the information embedded in the protein ensembles and in their dynamic signature. With this aim in mind, we should enrich the current tools for analysis of biomolecular simulations with attention to the effects that can be propagated over long distances and are often associated to important biological functions. In this context, approaches inspired by network analysis can make an important contribution to the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations.},

@article{Estrada2010a,
abstract = {Residue networks representing 595 nonhomologous proteins are studied. These networks exhibit universal topological characteristics as they belong to the topological class of modular networks formed by several highly interconnected clusters separated by topological cavities. There are some networks that tend to deviate from this universality. These networks represent small-size proteins having {\textless}200 residues. This article explains such differences in terms of the domain structure of these proteins. On the other hand, the topological cavities characterizing proteins residue networks match very well with protein binding sites. This study investigates the effect of the cutoff value used in building the residue network. For small cutoff values, {\textless}5 ?? , the cavities found are very large corresponding almost to the whole protein surface. On the contrary, for large cutoff value, {\textgreater}10.0 ?? , only very large cavities are detected and the networks look very homogeneous. These findings are useful for practical purposes as well as for identifying protein-like complex networks. Finally, this article shows that the main topological class of residue networks is not reproduced by random networks growing according to Erd??s- R??nyi model or the preferential attachment method of Barab??si- Albert. However, the Watts-Strogatz model reproduces very well the topological class as well as other topological properties of residue network. A more biologically appealing modification of the Watts-Strogatz model to describe residue networks is proposed. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

@article{Amitai2004a,
abstract = {Identifying active site residues strictly from protein three-dimensional structure is a difficult task, especially for proteins that have few or no homologues. We transformed protein structures into residue interaction graphs (RIGs), where amino acid residues are graph nodes and their interactions with each other are the graph edges. We found that active site, ligand-binding and evolutionary conserved residues, typically have high closeness values. Residues with high closeness values interact directly or by a few intermediates with all other residues of the protein. Combining closeness and surface accessibility identified active site residues in 70{\%} of 178 representative structures. Detailed structural analysis of specific enzymes also located other types of functional residues. These include the substrate binding sites of acetylcholinesterases and subtilisin, and the regions whose structural changes activate MAP kinase and glycogen phosphorylase. Our approach uses single protein structures, and does not rely on sequence conservation, comparison to other similar structures or any prior knowledge. Residue closeness is distinct from various sequence and structure measures and can thus complement them in identifying key protein residues. Closeness integrates the effect of the entire protein on single residues. Such natural structural design may be evolutionary maintained to preserve interaction redundancy and contribute to optimal setting of functional sites. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{DelSol2006a,
abstract = {The representation of protein structures as small-world networks facilitates the search for topological determinants, which may relate to functionally important residues. Here, we aimed to investigate the performance of residue centrality, viewed as a family fold characteristic, in identifying functionally important residues in protein families. Our study is based on 46 families, including 29 enzyme and 17 non-enzyme families. A total of 80{\%} of these central positions corresponded to active site residues or residues in direct contact with these sites. For enzyme families, this percentage increased to 91{\%}, while for non-enzyme families the percentage decreased substantially to 48{\%}. A total of 70{\%} of these central positions are located in catalytic sites in the enzyme families, 64{\%} are in hetero-atom binding sites in those families binding hetero-atoms, and only 16{\%} belong to protein-protein interfaces in families with protein-protein interaction data. These differences reflect the active site shape: enzyme active sites locate in surface clefts, hetero-atom binding residues are in deep cavities, while protein-protein interactions involve a more planar configuration. On the other hand, not all surface cavities or clefts are comprised of central residues. Thus, closeness centrality identifies functionally important residues in enzymes. While here we focus on binding sites, we expect to identify key residues for the integration and transmission of the information to the rest of the protein, reflecting the relationship between fold and function. Residue centrality is more conserved than the protein sequence, emphasizing the robustness of protein structures.},
