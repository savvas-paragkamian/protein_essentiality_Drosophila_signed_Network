abstract = {The draft sequence of the human genome became available almost a decade ago but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be "druggable", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical research system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark matter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few genome-derived targets have led to approved drugs.},

abstract = {Evolution produces complex and structured networks of interacting components in chemical, biological, and social systems. We describe a simple mathematical model for the evolution of an idealized chemical system to study how a network of cooperative molecular species arises and evolves to become more complex and structured. The network is modeled by a directed weighted graph whose positive and negative links represent "catalytic" and "inhibitory" interactions among the molecular species, and which evolves as the least populated species (typically those that go extinct) are replaced by new ones. A small autocatalytic set, appearing by chance, provides the seed for the spontaneous growth of connectivity and cooperation in the graph. A highly structured chemical organization arises inevitably as the autocatalytic set enlarges and percolates through the network in a short analytically determined timescale. This self organization does not require the presence of self-replicating species. The network also exhibits catastrophes over long timescales triggered by the chance elimination of "keystone" species, followed by recoveries.},

abstract = {Identification of protein-protein interactions often provides insight into protein function, and many cellular processes are performed by stable protein complexes. We used tandem affinity purification to process 4,562 different tagged proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each preparation was analysed by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to increase coverage and accuracy. Machine learning was used to integrate the mass spectrometry scores and assign probabilities to the protein-protein interactions. Among 4,087 different proteins identified with high confidence by mass spectrometry from 2,357 successful purifications, our core data set (median precision of 0.69) comprises 7,123 protein-protein interactions involving 2,708 proteins. A Markov clustering algorithm organized these interactions into 547 protein complexes averaging 4.9 subunits per complex, about half of them absent from the MIPS database, as well as 429 additional interactions between pairs of complexes. The data (all of which are available online) will help future studies on individual proteins as well as functional genomics and systems biology.},

Our analyses of public CRISPR screens suggest protein interaction networks, when integrated with gene expression or histone marks, are highly predictive of gene essentiality. Meanwhile, the quality of CRISPR and shRNA screen results can be significantly enhanced through network neighbor information. We also found network neighbor information to be very informative on prioritizing ChIP-seq target genes and survival indicator genes from tumor profiling. Thus, our study provides a general method for gene essentiality analysis in functional genomic experiments ( http://nest.dfci.harvard.edu ).},

@article{Faucon2014a,
abstract = {Fully-connected triads (FCTs), such as the Oct4-Sox2-Nanog triad, have been implicated as recurring transcriptional motifs embedded within the regulatory networks that specify and maintain cellular states. To explore the possible connections between FCT topologies and cell fate determinations, we employed computational network screening to search all possible FCT topologies for multistability, a dynamic property that allows the rise of alternate regulatory states from the same transcriptional network. The search yielded a hierarchy of FCTs with various potentials for multistability, including several topologies capable of reaching eight distinct stable states. Our analyses suggested that complete auto-activation is an effective indicator for multistability, and, when gene expression noise was incorporated into the model, the networks were able to transit multiple states spontaneously. Different levels of stochasticity were found to either induce or disrupt random state transitioning with some transitions requiring layovers at one or more intermediate states. Using this framework we simulated a simplified model of induced pluripotency by including constitutive overexpression terms. The corresponding FCT showed random state transitioning from a terminal state to the pluripotent state, with the temporal distribution of this transition matching published experimental data. This work establishes a potential theoretical framework for understanding cell fate determinations by connecting conserved regulatory modules with network dynamics. Our results could also be employed experimentally, using established developmental transcription factors as seeds, to locate cell lineage specification networks by using auto-activation as a cipher.},

abstract = {The origins of life likely required the cooperation among a set of molecular species interacting in a network. If so, then the earliest modes of evolutionary change would have been governed by the manners and mechanisms by which networks change their compositions over time. For molecular events, especially those in a pre-biological setting, these mechanisms have rarely been considered. We are only recently learning to apply the results of mathematical analyses of network dynamics to prebiotic events. Here, we attempt to forge connections between such analyses and the current state of knowledge in prebiotic chemistry. Of the many possible influences that could direct primordial network, six parameters emerge as the most influential when one considers the molecular characteristics of the best candidates for the emergence of biological information: polypeptides, RNA-like polymers, and lipids. These parameters are viable cores, connectivity kinetics, information control, scalability, resource availability, and compartmentalization. These parameters, both individually and jointly, guide the aggregate evolution of collectively autocatalytic sets. We are now in a position to translate these conclusions into a laboratory setting and test empirically the dynamics of prebiotic network evolution.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between the genotypes and phenotypes of individuals is key for identifying genetic variants responsible for disease and developing successful therapeutic strategies. Mapping the phenotypic effects of individual genetic variants and their combinations in human populations presents numerous practical and statistical challenges. However, model organisms, such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provide an incredible set of molecular tools and advanced technologies that should be able to efficiently perform this task. In particular, large-scale genetic interaction screens in yeast and other model systems have revealed common properties of genetic interaction networks, many of which appear to be maintained over extensive evolutionary distances. Indeed, despite relatively low conservation of individual genes and their pairwise interactions, the overall topology of genetic interaction networks and the connections between broad biological processes may be similar in most organisms. Taking advantage of these general principles should provide a fundamental basis for mapping and predicting genetic interaction networks in humans.},

The interaction between biology and evolution has been the subject of great interest in recent years. The author, Eric Davidson, has been instrumental in elucidating this relationship. He is a world renowned scientist and a major contributor to the field of developmental biology. The Regulatory Genome beautifully explains the control of animal development in terms of structure/function relations of inherited regulatory DNA sequence, and the emergent properties of the gene regulatory networks composed of these sequences. New insights into the mechanisms of body plan evolution are derived from considerations of the consequences of change in developmental gene regulatory networks. Examples of crucial evidence underscore each major concept. The clear writing style explains regulatory causality without requiring a sophisticated background in descriptive developmental biology. This unique text supersedes anything currently available in the market. The only book in the market that is solely devoted to the genomic regulatory code for animal development Written at a conceptual level, including many novel synthetic concepts that ultimately simplify understanding Presents a comprehensive treatment of molecular control elements that determine the function of genes Provides a comparative treatment of development, based on principles rather than description of developmental processes Considers the evolutionary processes in terms of the structural properties of gene regulatory networks Includes 42 full-color descriptive figures and diagrams},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput methods have provided us with a first glimpse of the overall structure of molecular interaction networks in biological systems. Ultimately, we expect that such information will change how we think about biological systems in a fundamental way. Instead of viewing the genetic parts list of an organism as a loose collection of biochemical activities, in the best case, we anticipate discrete networks of function to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype, and to do so in a more profound way than the current qualitative classification of linked reactions into familiar pathways, such as glycolysis and the MAPK signal transduction cascades. At the present time, however, we are still far from a complete answer to the most basic question: what can we learn about biology by studying networks? Promising steps in this direction have come from such diverse approaches as mathematical analysis of global network structure, partitioning networks into functionally related modules and motifs, and even de novo design of networks. A complete picture will probably require integrating the data obtained from all of these approaches with modeling efforts at many different levels of detail.},

@article{Balaji2006a,
abstract = {Numerous studies in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have shown that, under standard growth conditions, less than 20{\%} of the protein-coding genes are essential for survival. This suggests that biological systems have evolved to have a high degree of robustness to mutational disruptions that can affect the majority of their genes. This mutational robustness could arise either due to redundancy, i.e. direct backup, or due to distributed architecture, i.e. indirect backup where multiple genes contribute to the functioning of a process in the system. Despite clear evidence for direct backup, the prevalence of indirect backup is poorly understood. In this study, we reveal the existence of a hidden distributed architecture behind the scale-free transcriptional regulatory network of yeast by applying a unique network transformation procedure and show that the network is tolerant even to mutations that disrupt regulatory hubs. Contrary to what is generally accepted, our observation that hubs can be lost or replaced in evolution suggests that this hidden distributed architecture behind scale-free networks protects the overall transcriptional program of the organism from mutations affecting major regulatory hubs. We show that the distributed architecture has been provided by an unexpectedly large number of coordinating partners for any regulatory protein. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the existence of such architecture can allow organisms to explore the adaptive landscape in changing environments by providing the plasticity required to reprogram levels of expression of specific genes that may enhance survival. Thus, an "over-engineered" backup system in the form of distributed architecture is likely to be a major determinant of the "evolvability" of the gene expression in organisms faced with environmental diversity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have focused on the properties of individual prognostic genes, but have lacked a global view of their system-level properties. Here we examined their properties in gene co-expression networks for four cancer types using data from 'The Cancer Genome Atlas'. We found that prognostic mRNA genes tend not to be hub genes (genes with an extremely high connectivity), and this pattern is unique to the corresponding cancer-type-specific network. In contrast, the prognostic genes are enriched in modules (a group of highly interconnected genes), especially in module genes conserved across different cancer co-expression networks. The target genes of prognostic miRNA genes show similar patterns. We identified the modules enriched in various prognostic genes, some of which show cross-tumour conservation. Given the cancer types surveyed, our study presents a view of emergent properties of prognostic genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of publications have recently examined the occurrence and properties of the feed-forward motif in a variety of networks, including those that are of interest in genome biology, such as gene networks. The present work looks in some detail at the dynamics of the bi-fan motif, using systems of ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription factors, mRNA and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure. RESULTS: We develop an ordinary differential equation model of the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding to its behaviour under various conditions. In particular, we examine the effects of different steady and pulsed inputs to five variants of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan motifs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's yeast). Using this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour of the bi-fan motif for a wide range of biologically plausible parameters and configurations. We find that there is no characteristic behaviour for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be obtained. CONCLUSION: Even with this relatively simple model, the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses. This suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs. It is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which are currently difficult to obtain.},

We find that the typical lifetime of the system increases sharply with the diversity of its components or species. We also find that the prime reason for crashes is a naturally occurring internal fragility of the system. This fragility is captured in the network organizational character and is related to a reduced multiplicity of pathways or feedback loops between its components. These results apply to several generalizations of the model as well. This work suggests new parameters for understanding the robustness of evolving molecular networks, ecosystems, societies and markets.},

Here, we discuss the sampling properties of a network's degree distribution under the most parsimonious sampling scheme. Only if the degree distributions of the network and randomly sampled subnets belong to the same family of probability distributions is it possible to extrapolate from subnet data to properties of the global network. We show that this condition is indeed satisfied for some important classes of networks, notably classical random graphs and exponential random graphs. For scale-free degree distributions, however, this is not the case. Thus, inferences about the scale-free nature of a network may have to be treated with some caution. The work presented here has important implications for the analysis of molecular networks as well as for graph theory and the theory of networks in general.},

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Essential genes are indispensable to the viability of an organism. Identification and analysis of essential genes is key to understanding the systems level organization of living cells. On the other hand, the ability to predict these genes in pathogens is of great importance for directed drug development. Global analysis of protein interaction networks provides an effective way to elucidate the relationships between genes. It has been found that essential genes tend to be highly connected and generally have more interactions than nonessential ones. With recent large-scale identifications of essential genes and protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, we have systematically investigated the topological properties of essential and nonessential genes in the protein-protein interaction networks. Essential genes tend to play topologically more important roles in protein interaction networks. Many topological features were found to be statistically discriminative between essential and nonessential genes. In addition, we have also examined sequence properties such as open reading frame length, strand, and phyletic retention for their association with the gene essentiality. Employing the topological features in the protein interaction network and the sequence properties, we have built a machine learning classifier capable of predicting essential genes. Computational prediction of essential genes circumvents expensive and difficult experimental screens and will help antimicrobial drug development.},

Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processesremain poorly characterized.

Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages.

abstract = {Summary Gene essentiality is typically determined by assessing the viability of the corresponding mutant cells, but this definition fails to account for the ability of cells to adaptively evolve to genetic perturbations. Here, we performed a stringent screen to assess the degree to which Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells can survive the deletion of ???1,000 individual "essential" genes and found that ???9{\%} of these genetic perturbations could in fact be overcome by adaptive evolution. Our analyses uncovered a genome-wide gradient of gene essentiality, with certain essential cellular functions being more "evolvable" than others. Ploidy changes were prevalent among the evolved mutant strains, and aneuploidy of a specific chromosome was adaptive for a class of evolvable nucleoporin mutants. These data justify a quantitative redefinition of gene essentiality that incorporates both viability and evolvability of the corresponding mutant cells and will enable selection of therapeutic targets associated with lower risk of emergence of drug resistance.},

abstract = {In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the subunits of any given protein complex are either mostly essential or mostly nonessential, suggesting that essentiality is a property of molecular machines rather than individual components. There are exceptions to this rule, however, that is, nonessential genes in largely essential complexes and essential genes in largely nonessential complexes. Here, we provide explanations for these exceptions, showing that redundancy within complexes, as revealed by genetic interactions, can explain many of the former cases, whereas "moonlighting," as revealed by membership of multiple complexes, can explain the latter. Surprisingly, we find that redundancy within complexes cannot usually be explained by gene duplication, suggesting alternate buffering mechanisms. In the distantly related Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we observe the same phenomenon of modular essentiality, suggesting that it may be a general feature of eukaryotes. Furthermore, we show that complexes flip essentiality in a cohesive fashion between the two species, that is, they tend to change from mostly essential to mostly nonessential, or vice versa, but not to mixed patterns. We show that these flips in essentiality can be explained by differing lifestyles of the two yeasts. Collectively, our results support a previously proposed model where proteins are essential because of their involvement in essential functional modules rather than because of specific topological features such as degree or centrality.},

However, it is poorly known how well these quantitative interaction measurements agree across the screening approaches, which hinders their integrated use toward improving the coverage and quality of the genetic interaction maps in yeast and other organisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using large-scale data matrices from epistatic miniarray profiling (E-MAP), genetic interaction mapping (GIM), and synthetic genetic array (SGA) approaches, we carried out here a systematic comparative evaluation among these quantitative maps of genetic interactions in yeast. The relatively low association between the original interaction measurements or their customized scores could be improved using a matrix-based modelling framework, which enables the use of single- and double-mutant fitness estimates and measurements, respectively, when scoring genetic interactions. Toward an integrative analysis, we show how the detections from the different screening approaches can be combined to suggest novel positive and negative interactions which are complementary to those obtained using any single screening approach alone. The matrix approximation procedure has been made available to support the design and analysis of the future screening studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have shown here that even if the correlation between the currently available quantitative genetic interaction maps in yeast is relatively low, their comparability can be improved by means of our computational matrix approximation procedure, which will enable integrative analysis and detection of a wider spectrum of genetic interactions using data from the complementary screening approaches.},

abstract = {Biological gene networks appear to be dynamically robust to mutation, stochasticity, and changes in the environment and also appear to be sparsely connected. Studies with computational models, however, have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account, that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes, the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial design constraint that underlies biological organization.},

Yet studies into mRNA-protein correspondence have shown notoriously poor correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels, creating concern for inferences from only mRNA expression data. However, none of these studies have examined in particular differentially expressed mRNA. Here, we examined this question in an ovarian cancer xenograft model. We measured protein and mRNA expression for twenty-nine genes in four drug-treatment conditions and in untreated controls. We identified mRNAs differentially expressed between drug-treated xenografts and controls, then analysed mRNA-protein expression correlation across a five-point time-course within each of the four experimental conditions. We evaluated correlations between mRNAs and their protein products for mRNAs differentially expressed within an experimental condition compared to those that are not. We found that differentially expressed mRNAs correlate significantly better with their protein product than non-differentially expressed mRNAs. This result increases confidence for the use of differential mRNA expression for biological discovery in this system, as well as providing optimism for the usefulness of inferences from mRNA expression in general.},

We found that yeast nonessential genes become essential in mouse when their network connections rapidly increase through engagement in protein complexes. The increased interactions allowed the previously nonessential genes to become members of vital pathways. By accounting for changes in gene essentiality, we firmly reestablished the centrality-lethality rule, which proposed the relationship of essential genes and network hubs. Furthermore, we discovered that the number of connections associated with essential and non-essential genes depends on whether they were essential in ancestral species. Our study describes for the first time how network evolution occurs to change gene essentiality.},

Because a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a "second-generation" high-quality, high-throughput Y2H data set covering approximately 20{\%} of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins.

@article{Phillips1998a,
abstract = {VERY soon after the rediscovery of MENDEL it was realized that the multilocus nature of inheritance could not be understood solely by examining the action of individual genes and then predicting how these genes would behave in concert simply by combining the separate observations. Frequently genes interact with one another, distorting simple Mendelian ratios and sometimes leading to novel phenotypes. Ninety years ago, WILLIAM BATESON coined the term "epistasis" to describe this sort of interaction (he appears to have first used the term in 1908, although it is most clearly spelled out in BATESON 1909 ). Epistasis translates directly to "standing upon," and was meant to describe the situation in which the action of one locus masks the allelic effects at another locus, much in the same way that complete dominance (the way in which most genes appeared to work at the time) involves the masking of one allele by another. The locus being masked is said to be "hypostatic" to the other locus.  At the same time that he was investigating all manner of Mendelian segregation ratios, BATESON was involved in a heated battle with the Biometrical school of genetics, exemplified by the views of KARL PEARSON and W. F. R. WELDON (PROVINE 1971 ). The Biometricians focused on the continuous range of variation among relatives in contrast to the discrete differences studied by the Mendelians. Eighty years ago, in one of the seminal papers in genetics, R. A. FISHER 1918 conclusively ended the debate by showing analytically that Mendelian segregation was compatible with the Biometrician's laws of heredity (something that had been argued qualitatively by a number of others before FISHER). In this same work, he also established several branches of statistics and laid the groundwork for the entire field now known as quantitative genetics. It was quite a paper.  The essential problem with which FISHER had to deal was how to map the discrete segregation of alleles onto the continuous range of measured traits. FISHER noted that in conducting this mapping, it was entirely possible (although, as it was later clear, not likely to his mind), that one would not be able to predict the quantitative phenotype of a particular two-locus genotype by simply adding the effects of two loci together. With undoubted allusion to BATESON'S unusual segregation ratios, FISHER called these nonadditive interactions "epistacy." This term rapidly became simply "epistasis," and two related, but distinct meanings of the same word entered the geneticist's vocabulary (WADE 1992A ).  It is perhaps telling that this duality in meaning rarely causes much confusion for those using the term. Mendelian and molecular geneticists tend to use epistasis in the strict sense of BATESON, while evolutionary and quantitative geneticists use epistasis to mean just about any form of gene interaction. After briefly tracing the history of the use of "epistasis," I suggest that there is good reason to start thinking about eliminating this potential source of confusion. Some of the difficulty in choosing the right word to describe gene interactions results from the lingering conflict between the Biometrical and Mendelian views of characterizing gene action. The resolution to this difficulty points the way to the possible final synthesis of these two approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying essential genes in bacteria supports to identify potential drug targets and an understanding of minimal requirements for a synthetic cell. However, experimentally assaying the essentiality of their coding genes is resource intensive and not feasible for all bacterial organisms, in particular if they are infective.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed a machine learning technique to identify essential genes using the experimental data of genome-wide knock-out screens from one bacterial organism to infer essential genes of another related bacterial organism. We used a broad variety of topological features, sequence characteristics and co-expression properties potentially associated with essentiality, such as flux deviations, centrality, codon frequencies of the sequences, co-regulation and phyletic retention. An organism-wise cross-validation on bacterial species yielded reliable results with good accuracies (area under the receiver-operator-curve of 75{\%} - 81{\%}). Finally, it was applied to drug target predictions for Salmonella typhimurium. We compared our predictions to the viability of experimental knock-outs of S. typhimurium and identified 35 enzymes, which are highly relevant to be considered as potential drug targets. Specifically, we detected promising drug targets in the non-mevalonate pathway.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Using elaborated features characterizing network topology, sequence information and microarray data enables to predict essential genes from a bacterial reference organism to a related query organism without any knowledge about the essentiality of genes of the query organism. In general, such a method is beneficial for inferring drug targets when experimental data about genome-wide knockout screens is not available for the investigated organism.},

abstract = {Cellular functions are the result of the coordinated action of groups of proteins interacting in molecular assemblies or pathways. The systematic and unbiased charting of protein-protein networks in a variety of organisms has become an important challenge in systems biology. These protein-protein interaction networks contribute comprehensive cartographies of key pathways or biological processes relevant to health or disease by providing a molecular frame for the interpretation of genetic links. At a structural level protein-protein networks enabled the identification of the sequences, motifs and structural folds involved in the process of molecular recognition. A rapidly growing choice of technologies is available for the global charting of protein-protein interactions. In this review, we focus on recent developments in a suite of methods that enable the purification of protein complexes under native conditions and, in conjunction with protein mass spectrometry, identification of their constituents. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

@article{Ideker2012a,
abstract = {Protein and genetic interaction maps can reveal the overall physical and functional landscape of a biological system. To date, these interaction maps have typically been generated under a single condition, even though biological systems undergo differential change that is dependent on environment, tissue type, disease state, development or speciation. Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.},
